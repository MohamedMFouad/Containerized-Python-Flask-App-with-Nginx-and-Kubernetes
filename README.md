`make up`

While the process from the Makefile is running, open a new terminal window and run the following command:

bash
 
`watch -n 1 kubectl get po -n default --show-kind`

This will continuously display the status of the pods in the "default" namespace using the kubectl command with a refresh interval of 1 second.
